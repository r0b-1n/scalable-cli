Scalable CLI is a standalone CLI on top of the Scalable API. It is the local execution layer for Scalable Broker when you want something sturdier than
Selenium, browser scraping, or brittle UI scripts.

## Why use `sc`

- Use supported broker commands instead of browser automation or screen scraping.
- Work interactively in the terminal or use `--json` for local scripts and agent workflows.
- Review trades and savings-plan changes before submission with an explicit
  two-step confirmation flow.

## Install

### macOS

#### Option 1: Homebrew
1. Tap the repository:
   ```bash
   brew tap ScalableCapital/tap
   brew trust --formula ScalableCapital/tap/scalable-cli
   ```
2. Install the CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install scalable-cli
   ```

#### Option 2: Manual install
1. Download the macOS PKG installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/ScalableCapital/scalable-cli/releases).
2. Run the installer.

### Linux

#### Manual install
1. Download the tar.gz archive for your architecture (`x86_64` or `aarch64`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/ScalableCapital/scalable-cli/releases).
2. Extract the archive.
3. Move the `sc` binary to a directory on your `PATH`.

### Windows

#### Manual install
1. Build from source or download `sc.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ScalableCapital/scalable-cli/releases) when available.
2. Move `sc.exe` to a directory on your `PATH`.

Works in both Command Prompt (`cmd`) and PowerShell. Login sessions are stored in the
Windows Credential Manager by default; local files live under `%APPDATA%\scalable-cli`.
Credential Manager caps a single credential at 2560 bytes, so a session that exceeds it
is split across several `scalable.capital:scalable-cli` entries (`session`, `session.part0`, ...)
and reassembled on read.
The `secure_enclave` signing backend remains macOS-only and `pkcs11` remains Linux-only.

### Official binaries and source builds

Official Scalable-distributed binaries are the release assets published by
Scalable Capital on GitHub and the packages installed from the official
Scalable Homebrew tap.

If you build this repository yourself, use a fork, install from a third-party
package manager, pull a container image, or receive a redistributed binary from
someone else, that binary is not distributed by Scalable Capital. Only use
binaries whose source and provenance you trust, especially before logging in or
running broker commands.

### Basic verification

```bash
sc --version
sc --help
```

## Quick start

Scalable CLI is the official command line for the Scalable Broker.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you can use the CLI, enable Scalable CLI in your profile on the Scalable
**web platform** under Profile > Security > Agentic Investing.

Once you have enabled Scalable CLI in your profile on the Scalable web platform,
authenticate and confirm the CLI can access your Scalable Broker account:

```bash
sc login
sc whoami
sc capabilities --json
sc broker overview --json
```

`sc login` uses an OAuth 2.0 device-code flow.
For security and reliability, complete login yourself rather than via an AI agent.

Optional local write guard:

- `sc login --local-read-only` stores the session in a locally enforced read-only mode.
- This does not change token permissions or backend access.
- Read commands and local commands such as `sc broker context select` continue to work, while write commands are blocked locally until you run `sc login` again without `--local-read-only`.

## Release artifact provenance

Release assets include checksums and a minisign signature for the checksum
manifest. The examples below assume `minisign` and the GitHub CLI (`gh`) are
installed.

Each snippet below pins the current Scalable Capital minisign release signing
public key: `RWRKuuSASIzbSYpuU5gdXeTkXirJBl5+XVXLP6E60hBUUKZ5HPIGjV8b`.

## Common commands

### Identity and session

```bash
sc whoami
sc logout
```

### Overnight savings

```bash
sc overnight
sc overnight --savings-account-id <SAVINGS_ACCOUNT_ID>
sc overnight transactions --page-size 50 --type-filter interest
sc overnight transactions --savings-account-id <SAVINGS_ACCOUNT_ID> --json
```

`sc overnight` shows the dedicated overnight savings summary. It
auto-resolves the savings account when exactly one active account is accessible;
otherwise, provide `--savings-account-id`.

`sc overnight transactions` lists the deposits, withdrawals, interest, and
other cash transactions for the selected overnight account. It supports cursor
pagination, repeatable `--type-filter`, text search, and time-window filters.
Run `sc overnight transactions --help` for all available filters.

### Portfolio and market data

```bash
sc broker overview
sc broker analytics
sc broker transactions
sc broker transaction details --transaction-id <TRANSACTION_ID>
sc broker holdings
sc broker portfolio-groups
sc broker portfolio-groups --group-id <GROUP_ID>
sc broker chart --isin US0378331005 --timeframe 1m
sc broker quote --isin US0378331005
sc broker watchlist
sc broker search "apple"
sc broker derivatives search --underlying US0378331005 --type knockout --strategy long
sc broker security-news --isin US0378331005 --locale en_DE
```

`sc broker overview` reports the absolute return (`simpleAbsoluteReturn`) for
each available timeframe. It does not report a relative return percentage.

`sc broker portfolio-groups` returns all groups, their items, group-level since-buy
performance, and ungrouped holdings. Add `--group-id <GROUP_ID>` to narrow the
result to one existing group; filtered reads keep the same JSON shape but return
an empty `ungrouped_items` list.

Manage group metadata with lifecycle commands. `update` changes only the supplied
fields; use `--clear-description` to remove an existing description.

```bash
sc broker portfolio-groups create --name "AI portfolio" --description "tracked by agent"
sc broker portfolio-groups update --group-id <GROUP_ID> --name "Long-term portfolio"
sc broker portfolio-groups update --group-id <GROUP_ID> --clear-description
sc broker portfolio-groups delete --group-id <GROUP_ID>
sc broker portfolio-groups assign --group-id <GROUP_ID> --isin US0378331005 --isin IE00B4ND3602
sc broker portfolio-groups unassign --group-id <GROUP_ID> --isin US0378331005
```

`assign` moves each supplied holding into the target group, automatically removing it
from any other group. `unassign` removes holdings from the named group and returns them
to the ungrouped holdings list. Assigning a holding already in the target group, or
unassigning one that is not in it, returns a validation error.

`sc broker derivatives search` supports derivative discovery for a known
underlying ISIN. The selected derivative ISIN can then be quoted with
`sc broker quote --isin ...`. The CLI also verifies trade buy phase-1 input
acceptance for derivative-style ISINs.

### Watchlist, alerts and savings plans

```bash
sc broker watchlist add --isin US0378331005
sc broker watchlist remove --isin US0378331005
sc broker price-alerts --active-only
sc broker price-alerts add --isin US0378331005 --price 180.00
sc broker price-alerts add --ticker BTC --price 45000.00
sc broker price-alerts remove --alert-id <ALERT_ID>
sc broker savings-plans
sc broker savings-plans config --isin US0378331005
# Phase 1: preview; this does not create or update a plan.
sc broker savings-plans add --isin US0378331005 --amount 100
# Phase 2: run only after a separate affirmative client confirmation.
sc broker savings-plans add --isin US0378331005 --amount 100 --confirm <CONFIRMATION_ID>
sc broker savings-plans remove --isin US0378331005
```

Savings-plan additions and updates are intentionally two-step. Phase 1 returns
the full ex-ante cost disclosure calculated for `SEIX`, together with a
short-lived confirmation ID. Present every value in that disclosure to the
client, obtain an explicit affirmative response in a separate interaction,
then repeat the exact arguments with `--confirm <CONFIRMATION_ID>`.

If phase 2 has an unknown outcome, do not retry it. Run
`sc broker savings-plans` for the same account and portfolio to inspect the
result; only that successful list clears the local safety gate for a later,
deliberately new preview.

### Broker context

```bash
sc broker context show
sc broker context select --portfolio-id <PORTFOLIO_ID>
```

## Trading

Buy and sell flows are intentionally two-step.

Run the command once to preview the order and receive a confirmation ID:

```bash
sc broker trade buy --isin US0378331005 --amount 500 --order-type market
sc broker trade buy --isin US0378331005 --shares 2 --order-type market
```

Submit the exact same order with `--confirm` to place it:

```bash
sc broker trade buy --isin US0378331005 --amount 500 --order-type market \
  --confirm <CONFIRMATION_ID>
sc broker trade buy --isin US0378331005 --shares 2 --order-type market \
  --confirm <CONFIRMATION_ID>
```

If phase 1 explicitly requires unsuitable acknowledgement for the buy order, `--accept-unsuitable` confirms that you are aware of the risks and still want to proceed.

Buy orders require exactly one sizing input: `--amount` or `--shares`. Buy-side
share input currently accepts whole shares only.

The same confirmation model applies to sell orders:

```bash
sc broker trade sell --isin US0378331005 --shares 1 --order-type market
sc broker trade cancel --order-id <ORDER_ID>
```

Supported order types:

- `market`
- `limit`
- `stop`

Trade cancellation is a separate single-step command for pending orders. Use
the `order_id` returned by `sc broker trade buy` or `sc broker trade sell`; it
is the same ID shown in `sc broker transactions`.

Optional local trade controls can be configured in `config.toml` for CLI-based
trading:

- `allowed_isins`
- `denied_isins`
- `max_order_notional`

These controls are enforced locally by the CLI only. They do not change your
account permissions or backend trading permissions.

## Automation

- `sc capabilities --json` exposes the supported machine-readable command surface.
- `sc capabilities --json` also exposes the parsed local trade-control state in
  `local_trade_controls`.
- Broker commands support `--json` for compact structured output.
- `sc login` remains human-oriented in the current version.

## Help

```bash
sc --help
sc broker --help
sc broker trade buy --help
```

## Configuration

`config.toml` is optional local runtime config for storage backends. The default
configuration is platform-specific.

Example:

```toml
[auth]
session_backend = "keyring"
signing_key_backend = "secure_enclave"
```

Configuration options:

- session_backend: where the login session is stored. Supported values: `keyring`, `file`. Default is `keyring` on macOS/Linux/Windows.
- signing_key_backend: where the authentication signing key is stored. Supported values: `file`, `secure_enclave`, `pkcs11`. Default is `secure_enclave` on macOS and `file` on Linux/Windows. `secure_enclave` is macOS-only. `pkcs11` is Linux-only and opt-in.

### Local trade controls

You can optionally define local trade controls for the CLI:

```toml
[trade_controls]
allowed_isins = ["US0378331005", "IE00B4L5Y983"]
denied_isins = ["US88160R1014"]
max_order_notional = "1000"
```

Trade-control behavior:

- If a control is not configured, it is inactive.
- If neither `allowed_isins` nor `denied_isins` is configured, ISIN controls are inactive.
- If `allowed_isins = []`, no ISIN can be traded through the CLI.
- If both `allowed_isins` and `denied_isins` are configured, the effective set is `allowed_isins - denied_isins`.
- `max_order_notional` is checked against the prepared order notional before submission.

These controls apply only when trading through `sc`.

### Linux PKCS#11 signing key

PKCS#11 lets the CLI use an existing hardware token, smartcard, or HSM-backed
key for its authentication signing key. The CLI does not create, import, rotate,
delete, export, or store PKCS#11 private keys.

```toml
[auth]
signing_key_backend = "pkcs11"

[auth.pkcs11]
module_path = "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/opensc-pkcs11.so"
key_uri = "pkcs11:token=YubiKey%20PIV;id=%01"
```

PKCS#11 options:

- module_path: required path to the PKCS#11 provider library.
- key_uri: required PKCS#11 URI for the existing key.

The URI must start with `pkcs11:` and identify exactly one EC P-256 private
key. Use `id=` or `object=` to identify the key; add `token=`, `serial=`,
`manufacturer=`, or `model=` if needed to make token selection unambiguous.
Percent-encode binary IDs and spaces.

If the token requires login, use either the token/provider protected
authentication path or set `SC_PKCS11_PIN` in the environment. The CLI does not
prompt for or store the PIN.

PKCS#11 failures do not fall back to `file`. Switching signing backends changes
the authentication key identity, so run `sc login` again after changing this
setting.

Config file locations:

- macOS: ~/.config/scalable-cli/config.toml
- Linux: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/scalable-cli/config.toml, falling back to ~/.config/scalable-cli/config.toml
- Windows: %APPDATA%\scalable-cli\config.toml

## Build from source

Building from source is useful for inspection, local development, and advanced
users. A locally built binary is self-built; it is not an official
Scalable-distributed release artifact unless it was built and published by
Scalable Capital through the official release process above.

Build the production-channel binary:

```bash
cargo build --locked --release --features channel-prod --bin sc
```

The binary is written to:

```bash
target/release/sc
```

Verify the build:

```bash
target/release/sc --version
target/release/sc --help
```

## Run as a dedicated Unix user

If another local service needs to invoke `sc`, it can be useful to run the CLI as
a separate Unix user with a narrowly scoped `sudoers` rule.

This lets the application use the CLI without gaining direct access to files
created by the CLI, such as session or configuration data owned by
`scalable-cli-user`. That separation is useful for limiting data exposure and
reducing the blast radius if the calling application account is compromised.

### Create the user

Create the dedicated account:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash scalable-cli-user
```

If the user should not be able to log in interactively, use a non-login shell
instead:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /usr/sbin/nologin scalable-cli-user
```

Verify that the user exists:

```bash
id scalable-cli-user
```

### Configure `sudoers`

Assume the main application runs as Unix user `app-user` and should be allowed
to execute exactly the `sc` CLI as `scalable-cli-user`.

Create a dedicated `sudoers` file such as `/etc/sudoers.d/app-cli` with:

```sudoers
app-user ALL=(scalable-cli-user) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/sc
```

This means:

- `app-user` may use `sudo` without a password.
- The command runs as `scalable-cli-user`.
- Only `/usr/local/bin/sc` is allowed.

Set the required permissions on the file:

```bash
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/app-cli
```

Validate the `sudoers` configuration:

```bash
sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/app-cli
```

### Result

With that setup, `app-user` can run:

```bash
sudo -n -u scalable-cli-user /usr/local/bin/sc
```

The same rule does not allow arbitrary commands to run as
`scalable-cli-user`.

In practice, this means `app-user` can trigger `sc`, but does not automatically
get read access to files owned by `scalable-cli-user`. The CLI remains usable
while its local files stay isolated behind normal Unix file ownership.
